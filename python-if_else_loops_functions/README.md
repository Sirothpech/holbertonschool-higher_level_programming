# C - Python - if/else, loops, functions

## Introduction
This repository is about our project on Pyhton language after many months learning C programming language at Holberton School.

## Requirements
### General
* Allowed editors:```vi```, ```vim```, ```emacs```
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.*)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly ```#!/usr/bin/python3```
* A ```README.md``` file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using ```wc```

## Tasks and Prototype
### Tasks 0 to 12

* This program will assign a random signed number to the variable ```number``` each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable ```number``` is positive or negative.
* This program will assign a random signed number to the variable ```number``` each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable ```number```.
* Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
 - You can only use one ```print``` function with string format
 - You can only use one loop in your code
* Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
 - Print all the letters except q and e
 - You can only use one print function with string format
 - You can only use one loop in your code
* Write a program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal (as in the following example)
* Write a program that prints numbers from 0 to 99.
* Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
* Write a function that checks for lowercase character.
* Write a function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line.
* Write a function that prints the last digit of a number.
* Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result.
