# C - Python - import & modules

## Introduction
This repository is about our project on Pyhton language after many months learning C programming language at Holberton School.

## Requirements
### General
* Allowed editors:```vi```, ```vim```, ```emacs```
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.*)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly ```#!/usr/bin/python3```
* A ```README.md``` file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using ```wc```

## Tasks and Prototype
### Tasks 0 to 5

* Write a program that imports the function ```def add(a, b):``` from the file ```add_0.py``` and prints the result of the addition ```1 + 2 = 3```
 - Your code should not be executed when imported - by using __import__, like the example below
 * Write a program that imports functions from the file ```calculator_1.py```, does some Maths, and prints the result.
 * Write a program that prints the number of and the list of its arguments.
 * Write a program that prints the result of the addition of all arguments
 * Write a program that prints all the names defined by the compiled module ```hidden_4.pyc``` (please download it locally).
