# JavaScript - Web jQuery

This repository contains a set of JavaScript exercises using jQuery for web development.

## Exercise 0: No JQuery
In this exercise, you will write a JavaScript script that updates the text color of the `<header>` element to red (#FF0000). You must use `document.querySelector` to select the HTML tag, and you can't use the jQuery API.

### Test the Exercise
Use the following HTML file to test your script: [0-main.html](0-main.html).

## Exercise 1: With JQuery
This exercise is similar to the previous one, but now you can't use `document.querySelector` to select the HTML tag. Instead, you must use the jQuery API.

### Test the Exercise
Use the following HTML file to test your script: [1-main.html](1-main.html).

## Exercise 2: Click and Turn Red
In this exercise, you will write a JavaScript script that updates the text color of the `<header>` element to red (#FF0000) when the user clicks on the tag `<DIV id="red_header">`. You must use the jQuery API, and you can't use `document.querySelector` to select the HTML tag.

### Test the Exercise
Use the following HTML file to test your script: [2-main.html](2-main.html).

## Exercise 3: Add `.red` Class
Write a JavaScript script that adds the class `.red` to the `<header>` element when the user clicks on the tag `<DIV id="red_header">`. You must use the jQuery API, and you can't use `document.querySelector` to select the HTML tag.

### Test the Exercise
Use the following HTML file to test your script: [3-main.html](3-main.html).

## Exercise 4: Toggle Classes
In this exercise, you will write a JavaScript script that toggles the class of the `<header>` element when the user clicks on the tag `<DIV id="toggle_header">`. The `<header>` element must always have one class: `.red` or `.green`, never both at the same time and never empty. You must use the jQuery API, and you can't use `document.querySelector` to select the HTML tag.

### Test the Exercise
Use the following HTML file to test your script: [4-main.html](4-main.html).

## Exercise 5: List of Elements
Write a JavaScript script that adds a `<li>` element to a list when the user clicks on the tag `<DIV id="add_item">`. The new element must be `<li>Item</li>`, and it must be added to `<UL class="my_list">`. You must use the jQuery API, and you can't use `document.querySelector` to select the HTML tag.

### Test the Exercise
Use the following HTML file to test your script: [5-main.html](5-main.html).

## Exercise 6: Change the Text
In this exercise, you will write a JavaScript script that updates the text of the `<header>` element to "New Header!!!" when the user clicks on `<DIV id="update_header">`. You must use the jQuery API, and you can't use `document.querySelector` to select the HTML tag.

### Test the Exercise
Use the following HTML file to test your script: [6-main.html](6-main.html).

## Exercise 7: Star Wars Character
Write a JavaScript script that fetches the character name from the URL [https://swapi-api.hbtn.io/api/people/5/?format=json](https://swapi-api.hbtn.io/api/people/5/?format=json). The name must be displayed in the HTML tag `<DIV id="character">`. You must use the jQuery API, and you can't use `document.querySelector` to select the HTML tag.

### Test the Exercise
Use the following HTML file to test your script: [7-main.html](7-main.html).

## Exercise 8: Star Wars Movies
In this exercise, you will write a JavaScript script that fetches and lists the title for all movies using the URL [https://swapi-api.hbtn.io/api/films/?format=json](https://swapi-api.hbtn.io/api/films/?format=json). All movie titles must be listed in the HTML tag `<UL id="list_movies">`. You must use the jQuery API, and you can't use `document.querySelector` to select the HTML tag.

### Test the Exercise
Use the following HTML file to test your script: [8-main.html](8-main.html).

## Exercise 9: Say Hello!
Write a JavaScript script that fetches the translation of "hello" from [https://hellosalut.stefanbohacek.dev/?lang=fr](https://hellosalut.stefanbohacek.dev/?lang=fr) and displays the translation in the HTML tag `<DIV id="hello">`. You must use the jQuery API, and your script must work when imported from the `<head>` tag.

### Test the Exercise
Use the following HTML file to test your script: [9-main.html](9-main.html).

Have fun completing these JavaScript exercises!
