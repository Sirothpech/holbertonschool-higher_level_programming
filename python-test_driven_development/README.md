# Python - Classes and Objects

## Introduction
This repository is about our project on Pyhton language after many months learning C programming language at Holberton School.

## Requirements
### General
* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
* A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
* All your modules should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
* All your classes should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`)
* All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and python3 -c 'print(`__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`)
* A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)

### Python Tests Cases
* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All your files should end with a new line
* All your test files should be inside a folder `tests`
* All your test files should be text files (extension: `.txt`)
* All your tests should be executed by using this command: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
* All your modules should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
* All your functions should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'`)
* A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
* We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case – The Checker is checking for tests!

## Tasks and Prototype
### Tasks 0 to 5

* Write a function that adds 2 integers. Prototype: `def add_integer(a, b=98)`:
* Write a function that divides all elements of a matrix.
 - Prototype: `def matrix_divided(matrix, div)`:
* Write a function that prints `My name is <first name> <last name>`.
 - Prototype: `def say_my_name(first_name, last_name="")`:
* Write a function that prints a square with the character `#`.
 - Prototype: `def print_square(size)`:
* Write a function that prints a text with 2 new lines after each of these characters: `.`, `?` and `:`
 - Prototype: `def text_indentation(text)`:
* Since the beginning you have been creating “Interactive tests”. For this exercise, you will add Unittests.
- In this task, you will write unittests for the function `def max_integer(list=[])`:.
