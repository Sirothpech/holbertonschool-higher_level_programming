# Python - Classes and Objects

## Introduction
This repository is about our project on Pyhton language after many months learning C programming language at Holberton School.

## Requirements
### General
* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
* A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
* All your modules should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
* All your classes should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`)
* All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and python3 -c 'print(`__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`)
* A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)

## Tasks and Prototype
### Tasks 0 to 6

* Write an empty class `Square` that defines a square:
* Write a class Square that defines a square by: (`based on 0-square.py`)
* Write a class Square that defines a square by: (`based on 1-square.py`)
* Write a class Square that defines a square by: (`based on 2-square.py`)
* Write a class Square that defines a square by: (`based on 3-square.py`)
* Write a class Square that defines a square by: (`based on 4-square.py`)
* Write a class Square that defines a square by: (`based on 5-square.py`)
