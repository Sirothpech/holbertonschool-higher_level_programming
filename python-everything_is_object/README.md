# Python - Everything is object

## Introduction
This repository is about our project on Pyhton language after many months learning C programming language at Holberton School.

## Requirements
### General
* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
* A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

### `.txt` Answer Files
* Only one line
* No Shebang on the first line (i.e. “#!/usr/bin/python3”)
* All your files should end with a new line

## Tasks and Prototype
### Tasks 0 to 29 (display until task 10)

* What function would you use to print the type of an object?
* How do you get the variable identifier (which is the memory address in the CPython implementation)?
* In the following code, do a and b point to the same object? Answer with Yes or No.
```
>>> a = 89
>>> b = 100
```
* In the following code, do a and b point to the same object? Answer with Yes or No.
```
>>> a = 89
>>> b = 89
```
* In the following code, do a and b point to the same object? Answer with Yes or No.
```
>>> a = 89
>>> b = a
```
* In the following code, do a and b point to the same object? Answer with Yes or No.
```
>>> a = 89
>>> b = a + 1
```
* What do these 3 lines print?
```
>>> s1 = "Best School"
>>> s2 = s1
>>> print(s1 == s2)
```
* What do these 3 lines print?
```
>>> s1 = "Best"
>>> s2 = s1
>>> print(s1 is s2)
```
* What do these 3 lines print?
```
>>> s1 = "Best School"
>>> s2 = "Best School"
>>> print(s1 == s2)
```
* What do these 3 lines print?
```
>>> s1 = "Best School"
>>> s2 = "Best School"
>>> print(s1 is s2)
```
* What do these 3 lines print?
```
>>> l1 = [1, 2, 3]
>>> l2 = [1, 2, 3]
>>> print(l1 == l2)
```
